# tiny-redux
Simplified redux implementation for learning purposes. **Not meant for Production use**.

This shows a very simple implementation of redux, and a very simple app using that implementation. You should be able to swap out tiny-redux.js with regular redux and everything should work just fine.

## Loading this in a browser
On chrome openind index.html will work, but you'll need to use a webserver like https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server to to serve up the js files
get around cors limitations (because of the `script type="module"`).

## Loading this in node.js
You could just paste tiny-redux.js into index.js and run `node index.js`
